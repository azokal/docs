"This section explains how main configuration file ``conf/config.yml`` "

msgid ""
"By default, every Roadiz environment read ``conf/config.yml`` "
"configuration file. But you can specify different files for ``dev`` and "
"``test`` environments. Just create a ``conf/config_dev.yml`` or "
"``conf/config_test.yml`` file to override default parameters. You will be"
" able to use a different database, mailer or *Solr* instance not to "
"pollute your production environment."

"Sometimes, if a cache extension is available but you don’t want to use "
