.. warning ::
    You may need to have a look at `Youtube <https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/>`_'s and `SoundCloud <https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs>`_'s documentation, as you need an access token to have embedded documents from both of them.



Random document
---------------

'Random' is a cool feature that allows to upload random documents to your website from Splashbase. It uses REST API and it works pretty well.
