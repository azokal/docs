If you want to contribute to this project by report issue or hacking code, let us thank you! You are awesome!

Reporting issues
----------------

When you encounter an issue with Roadiz weâ€™d love to hear about it. Because thank to you we can make the most awesome and stable CMS! If you submit a bug report please include all the information available to you, here are some things you can do:

- Try to simplify the things you are doing until getting a minimal set of actions reproducing the problem.
- Don't forget to put a screenshot or a copy of the error.

Running the tests
-----------------

If you developed a new feature or simply want to try out an installation of Roadiz you can run the unit tests. For this you will need to install the requirements for the testing framework, this can easily be done using:

.. code-block:: console

    composer update-dev

The unit tests can be launched by the command:

.. code-block:: console

    ./vendor/bin/phpunit -v --bootstrap=bootstrap.php --coverage-clover ./build/logs/clover.xml tests/

If your are writing a feature, don't forget to write a unit test for it. You can find some example in the folder ``tests``.

Coding style
------------

The code you contribute to the project should respect the guidelines defined in PSR2 standard.
If you install the requirements for dev by the command:

.. code-block:: console

    composer update-dev

you can use phpcs to check your code. We make command line for you to check easily:

.. code-block:: console

    ./vendor/bin/phpcs --report=full --report-file=./report.txt \
        --extensions=php --warning-severity=0 \
        --standard=PSR2 \
        --ignore=*/node_modules/*,*/.AppleDouble,*/vendor/*,*/cache/*,*/gen-src/*,*/Tests/* \
        -p ./

Please take those rules into account, we aim to have a clean codebase and codestyle is a big part of that. Your code will be checked when we consider your pull requests.
